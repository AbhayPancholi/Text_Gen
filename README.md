# Jungle Book Text Generator using LSTM

This repository contains a text generation model built using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The model has been trained on the text from the literary work "The Jungle Book" by Rudyard Kipling.

## Overview

The code provided here showcases the process of training an LSTM model on the text from "The Jungle Book" to generate new text. The steps included are:

### 1. Data Loading and Cleaning

The text from "The Jungle Book" is loaded and preprocessed to prepare it for training. This includes converting the text to lowercase and removing numerical values.

### 2. Data Preparation

The characters in the text are tokenized, and dictionaries mapping characters to integers and vice versa are created. Sequences of characters are formed for input and output for training the model.

### 3. Model Building

A sequential model using Keras with multiple LSTM layers is constructed. The model architecture consists of LSTM layers followed by a dense layer for character prediction.

### 4. Training

The model is trained on the prepared data for a specified number of epochs. Training loss is visualized using matplotlib to observe model performance over epochs.

### 5. Text Generation

A function is defined to generate text using the trained model. A seed sentence is provided as input, and the model generates new text character by character.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Keras
- numpy
- matplotlib

### Instructions

1. Load the provided code in an environment capable of running Python scripts, such as Google Colab.
2. Ensure all necessary libraries are installed.
3. Run the code sections sequentially as per the instructions/comments to train the model.
4. Optionally, load pre-trained weights or re-train the model by adjusting parameters.
5. Utilize the text generation function to generate new text based on the trained model.

## Additional Notes

- The provided code serves as a demonstration of using LSTM for text generation and can be extended or modified for different texts or purposes.
- Experiment with hyperparameters, model architectures, and text sources for diverse text generation outputs.
